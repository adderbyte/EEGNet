Please open the .ipynb file for code.
Would recommend not to use ELU, as I got inferior performance in my tests. 

Please follow the data format specified in the notebook, otherwise Pytorch might throw up some data format errors. 
Please raise a PR if you spot an error. 

Happy researching! If this helped you, please star the repo.
